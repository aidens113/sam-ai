# sam-ai
I'm building a multipurpose Discord AI bot called Sam
<br><br>
Details & goals of the project: <br>
-Sam will read every incoming message<br>
-Sam should act and talk like a normal human for the most part<br>
-Sam should decide whether or not to respond to a message on it's own<br>
-Sam should be able to automatically search the internet if it thinks a message is a question/needs help<br>
-Sam should be able to hold a conversation to some extent<br>
