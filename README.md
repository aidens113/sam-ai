# sam-ai
I'm building a multipurpose Discord AI bot called Sam

Details & goals of the project: 
-Sam will read every incoming message
-Sam should act and talk like a normal human for the most part
-Sam should decide whether or not to respond to a message on it's own
-Sam should be able to automatically search the internet if it thinks a message is a question/needs help
-Sam should be able to hold a conversation to some extent
